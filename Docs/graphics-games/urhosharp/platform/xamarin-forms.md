# UrhoSharp Xamarin.Forms support

UrhoSharp can be hosted in Xamarin.Forms applications. The Urho code
can be written in a PCL and shared across platforms.

Follow these instructions for [adding UrhoSharp to Xamarin.Forms](~/xamarin-forms/user-interface/graphics/urhosharp.md),
and refer to the [UrhoSharp documentation](~/graphics-games/urhosharp/using.md)
for information on how to construct 3D scenes and actions.

The [UrhoSharp Xamarin.Forms sample](https://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples/tree/master/FormsSample)
shows a 3D interactive chart to demonstrate how to interact with UrhoSharp
from Xamarin.Forms shared code.
